important note to point out:
double chute â€” if one available but one full, technically there is still no downtime, because conveyers are still moving
let's clearly define "downtime" exactly how usps would like.

only alarms for bins we get:
Bin_BLeft_Full
Bin_BLeft_BinNotPresentTimeout
Bin_BLeft_BinNotResumed Timout

unsure:
OutputBPaused
OutputBJam

questions for gabe:
what does usps want from us exactly?
how can i help?
