show kiran's code vs. my code, how to merge
timestamp to datetime conversion duplicate in our code
validation: if trigger_counts[alarm_id] > 0 duplicates in our code that can be merged seamlessly

important note to point out:
double chute â€” if one available but one full, technically there is still no downtime, because conveyers are still moving
let's clearly define "downtime" exactly how usps would like.

only alarms for bins we get:
Bin_BLeft_Full
Bin_BLeft_BinNotPresentTimeout   --->   how many seconds until "timeout"?
Bin_BLeft_BinNotResumedTimeout

unsure:
OutputBPaused   ---> 10 seconds (?) within PLC
OutputBJam

main.py -> alpha-numerical sort

questions for gabe:
what does usps want from us exactly?
how can i help?
